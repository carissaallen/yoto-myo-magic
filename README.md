# Yoto Card Magic

> _Automatically match icons to your MYO playlist tracks on Yoto._

Transform the way you create Yoto cards! Yoto Card Magic is a Chrome Extension that intelligently matches icons to your Make Your Own (MYO) playlist tracks, saving you time and making your cards more visually appealing.

## What It Does

Instead of manually selecting an icon for each track in your MYO playlists, Yoto Card Magic automatically analyzes your track titles and suggests the perfect icons from Yoto's collection.

**Before Yoto Card Magic:**
- Manually browse through hundreds of icons for each track
- Spend minutes per track finding the right visual match
- Risk inconsistent styling across your playlist

**After Yoto Card Magic:**
- One-click automatic icon matching for entire playlists
- Smart suggestions based on track titles and themes
- Cohesive, professional-looking cards in seconds
